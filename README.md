## üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.astro
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Adding Images

### Regular Blog Images
For regular blog content, screenshots, or illustrations, use standard markdown image syntax:
```markdown
![Description of the image](path/to/image.jpg)
```

### Photography
For photography where you want to preserve the original composition and add a caption, use the photography figure class:

```markdown
<figure class="photography">
  <img src="path/to/photo.jpg" alt="Description of the photo" />
  <figcaption>Photo by John Doe | Location, 2024</figcaption>
</figure>
```

The photography class provides:
- Natural image display (no forced dimensions)
- Centered images
- Proper spacing
- Styled captions
- Responsive behavior while maintaining original proportions

### Image Guidelines
1. **File Format**: Use `.jpg` for photographs, `.png` for screenshots or images with transparency
2. **Size**: 
   - Maximum width: 2000px
   - Recommended size: 1200-1600px wide
   - Keep file size under 500KB when possible
3. **Aspect Ratios**:
   - Photography: Natural dimensions preserved
   - Regular blog images: 16:9 (recommended)
4. **Alt Text**: Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility
5. **Captions**: Use captions for photography to provide context and attribution

### Example Post with Images
```markdown
---
title: "My Photography Journey"
